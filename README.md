# File Organizer — Progresif Media

A GUI tool for creating and reorganising project folders. Supports 5 project types across animation, editing, and design.

---

## For Team Members

You only need one file: **`00.FileOrganizer.bat`**

1. Drop `00.FileOrganizer.bat` into your project folder
2. Double-click it
3. The tool opens with your folder pre-filled
4. Pick your project type and mode, then hit **Preview** or **Run**

The tool updates automatically every time you open it — no need to download new versions.

> Requires Python to be installed on your machine. See [Installing Python](#installing-python) below if you haven't done this yet.

---

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Create new project structure** | Builds empty folders in the selected directory |
| **Reorganise existing folder** | Sorts existing files into the correct folders |

Run **Preview** first to see what will move without touching anything. Then **Run** to apply. Use **Undo** if you change your mind — it reverses the last reorganisation.

> **Multiple cameras:** `CAM_A` is created by default. For additional cameras, duplicate the folder and rename it — e.g. `CAM_B`, `CAM_C`. Create matching folders in both `Raw/` and `Proxies/` so highres and proxy files stay paired.

## File Sorting Rules

When using **Reorganise**, files are matched by extension and filename. First match wins.

| Extension | Condition | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| `.aep` | — | `00_Project_Files/AfterEffects/projects/` |
| `.blend` `.blend1` `.fspy` | — | `00_Project_Files/Blender/scenes/` |
| `.ai` | — | `00_Project_Files/Illustrator/` |
| `.psd` | — | `00_Project_Files/Photoshop/` |
| `.drp` `.drt` | — | `00_Project_Files/DaVinci/` |
| `.sesx` | — | `00_Project_Files/Audition/` |
| `.mp4` `.mov` `.avi` | name has `final` | `03_Exports/Finals/` |
| `.mp4` `.mov` `.avi` | — | `03_Exports/Drafts/` |
| `.mp3` | — | `01_Assets/Audio/Music/` |
| `.wav` | name has `vo` or `voice` | `01_Assets/Audio/VO/` |
| `.wav` | in a folder named `fx` | `01_Assets/Audio/SFX/` |
| `.pdf` | name has `logo` | `02_Exports/Brand/` *(GFX only)* |
| `.pdf` | name has `print` | `02_Exports/Print/` *(GFX only)* |
| `.pdf` | name has `brief` | `03_Docs/Brief/` |
| `.pdf` | — | `03_Docs/References/` |
| `.svg` | name has `logo` or `web` | `02_Exports/Brand/` or `Digital/Web/` |
| `.svg` | — | `01_Assets/Icons/` |
| `.ttf` `.otf` `.woff` | — | `01_Assets/Fonts/` |
| `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` | in a folder named `texture` | `01_Assets/Images/Textures/` |
| `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` | — | `01_Assets/Images/References/` |
| Numbered image sequence folder | ≥70% numbered files | `02_Renders/Blender/SEQ/` *(moved as a unit)* |

Files that don't match any rule are left in place and listed in the summary.

## Installing Python

Python only needs to be installed once per machine.

### Option 1 — Command line (recommended)

This installs Python and automatically adds it to PATH in one step.

**Step 1.** Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter

**Step 2.** Paste and run this command:

```cmd
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3 --override "PrependPath=1 Include_pip=1 /quiet"
```

**Step 3.** Wait for it to finish, then close and reopen CMD

**Step 4.** Type `python --version` to confirm — you should see `Python 3.x.x`

---

### Option 2 — Manual installer

1. Go to **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and download the latest version
2. Run the installer
3. **Important:** Tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** on the first screen before clicking Install Now

   > If you miss this step, the tool won't open. Uninstall Python from **Control Panel → Programs** and reinstall with the box ticked.

4. Click **Install Now**, wait, then click **Close**

---

**To verify either method worked:**
- Open CMD (`Windows + R` → type `cmd` → Enter)
- Type `python --version` and press Enter
- You should see `Python 3.x.x`

---

## Updating the Tool (Admin)

Make changes to `reorganise.py` on your machine, then push:

```
git add reorganise.py
git commit -m "describe what changed"
git push
```

The team gets the update automatically next time they open `00.FileOrganizer.bat`.
